How It Works
Our rice donation system is built on a sustainable financial model that ensures continuous support for those in need:

Growing Rice Fund: This is our principal investment of $1,000 growing at 4.5% interest annually. This fund remains untouched, ensuring sustainable growth.
Interest Generation: The interest earned becomes our "Ready for Harvest" amount, which funds the rice donations without depleting the principal.
Rice Distribution: Every $1 in the Ready for Harvest fund converts to 4 meals, with each meal providing 5,000 grains of rice.
Meditation Impact: Your meditation sessions directly contribute to rice donations, making real-world impact while you practice mindfulness.

How does meditation on this app help fight hunger?
For every minute you meditate, our app tracks your contribution in grains of rice (10 grains per minute). Once a year, all grains of rice earned by users are converted into monetary donations. This is done by calculating the average price of rice per kilogram in developing countries and making a donation to the World Food Programme (WFP).

Is this app sponsored by or affiliated with the World Food Programme?
No, this app is not directly sponsored or affiliated with the World Food Programme. However, it makes annual donations based on user contributions to support their global hunger initiatives.

How much rice is earned by meditating?
You earn 10 grains of rice per minute. For example, meditating for 10 minutes generates 100 grains of rice.

Can meditation really help fight global hunger?
Yes! With 8.16 billion people on the planet, if everyone meditated for 10 minutes a day, we could generate the equivalent of 816 billion grains of rice daily. This would far exceed the 360 billion to 600 billion grains needed to feed all 36 million starving children globally.

How many grains of rice are needed to feed starving children?
Feeding 36 million starving children costs $18 million per day, which translates to 360 billion to 600 billion grains of rice at a cost of $0.00003 to $0.00005 per grain.

Why focus on meditation to fight hunger?
Meditation not only fosters personal well-being but also creates a ripple effect of positive change. By meditating, you support your mental health while contributing to a global cause.
